## Introduction

Authy is an innovative and secure way to authenticate users by replacing traditional text-based passwords with graphical images. This system aims to enhance security and protect users from common password-related vulnerabilities, such as social engineering attacks and password reuse.

## Features

- **Enhanced Security**: Graphical passwords offer increased security compared to traditional text-based passwords, as they are less susceptible to common attacks like brute-force and dictionary attacks.

- **Protection against Social Engineering**: Regular, commonly used passwords can be easily guessed through social engineering. With graphical passwords, the chances of successful social engineering attacks are significantly reduced.

- **User-Friendly Experience**: Graphical passwords provide a more intuitive and user-friendly authentication experience, making it easier for users to remember and input their passwords.

- **Increased Complexity**: Graphical passwords can provide a higher level of complexity, as users can choose from a wide range of images, patterns, or gestures for authentication.
